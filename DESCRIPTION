Title: Hyperbolic Geometry
Version: 1.0.1.9000
Author: Stéphane Laurent
Maintainer: Stéphane Laurent <laurent_step@outlook.fr>
Description: Hyperbolic geometry in the Minkowski model and the Poincaré model. The methods are based on the gyrovector space theory developed by A. A. Ungar that can be found in the book 'Analytic Hyperbolic Geometry: Mathematical Foundations And Applications' <doi:10.1142/5914>. The package provides functions to plot three-dimensional hyperbolic polyhedra and to plot hyperbolic tilings of the Poincaré disk.
